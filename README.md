Project Title: Bat Ball Stump Game

Project Description:
This is a simple web-based game where the player competes against the computer in a game of chance using three choices: Bat, Ball, and Stump. <br>The game logic is inspired by Rock-Paper-Scissors. Players choose one of the three options, and the computer randomly selects its move.
<br>The result is then calculated based on predefined rules:
 <br>
Bat beats Ball but loses to Stump.
Ball beats Stump but loses to Bat.
Stump beats Bat but loses to Ball.

 <br>The game tracks the number of wins, losses, and ties, which are stored in the browser's local storage to maintain the score across sessions. The game also features a reset option to clear the current score and start over. Additionally, a win sound effect plays when the player wins a round.

 <br>Technologies Used:

 <br>HTML5 for structuring the game interface.
 <br>CSS3 for styling the game elements.
 <br>JavaScript for game logic, user interaction, and score management.
 <br>LocalStorage for persisting the score across sessions.
 <br>Audio element for adding sound effects.
 <br>Features:

 <br>Intuitive button-based interface with images representing each choice.
 <br>Real-time result display after each move.
 <br>Persistent score tracking across sessions using localStorage.
 <br>Simple and engaging gameplay with a win sound effect for user feedback.
 <br>Reset button to clear the score and restart the game.
 <br>This project showcases fundamental web development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, local storage, and basic game logic implementation.
