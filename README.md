Project Title: Bat Ball Stump Game

Project Description:
This is a simple web-based game where the player competes against the computer in a game of chance using three choices: Bat, Ball, and Stump. The game logic is inspired by Rock-Paper-Scissors. Players choose one of the three options, and the computer randomly selects its move. The result is then calculated based on predefined rules:

Bat beats Ball but loses to Stump.
Ball beats Stump but loses to Bat.
Stump beats Bat but loses to Ball.
The game tracks the number of wins, losses, and ties, which are stored in the browser's local storage to maintain the score across sessions. The game also features a reset option to clear the current score and start over. Additionally, a win sound effect plays when the player wins a round.

Technologies Used:

HTML5 for structuring the game interface.
CSS3 for styling the game elements.
JavaScript for game logic, user interaction, and score management.
LocalStorage for persisting the score across sessions.
Audio element for adding sound effects.
Features:

Intuitive button-based interface with images representing each choice.
Real-time result display after each move.
Persistent score tracking across sessions using localStorage.
Simple and engaging gameplay with a win sound effect for user feedback.
Reset button to clear the score and restart the game.
This project showcases fundamental web development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, local storage, and basic game logic implementation.
